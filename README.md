## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is essential for web development. This repository serves as a log of my learning process, including fundamental concepts, exercises, and projects to demonstrate my progress.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this repository, you should have:

- A basic understanding of HTML and CSS
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RitikRK96/Chai-and-Javascript.git
    cd Chai-and-Javascript
    ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE.**

3. **Start with the basics:**

    Navigate to the `basics/` directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the examples in action. Review the corresponding JavaScript files to understand the concepts being demonstrated.
